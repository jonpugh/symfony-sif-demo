Symfony SIF 3.0 REST Client Demo
================================
This code is research into using the Symfony framework
to build a SIF Agent/REST Client.

More coming soon.

Usage
=====

1. Clone the code:

    $ git clone git@github.com:jonpugh/symfony-sif-demo.git
    $ cd symfony-sif-demo

2. Run a web server: PHP can do this all by itself.

    $ php app/console server:run
    
3. Visit http://localhost:8000

  You will see the information used to connect to the SIF REST Demo server.
